{ What's Crumbs? }

Crumbs is a decentralized blockchain reward system, with deposits and investments paying interest rates, without involvement of financial institutions, powered by 100% open source code.

Crumbs enables untraceable and anonymous messaging, and a secure way to transfer funds. Using a distributed public ledger, the sender and receiver are kept anonymous.

Crumbs Cryptocurrency (XCR) is based on the Cryptonote protocol and runs on a secure peer-to-peer network technology to operate with no central authority. You control the private keys to your funds.

Crumbs is accessible by anyone in the world regardless of their geographic location or status. Our blockchain is resistant to any kind of analysis. All your XCR transactions and messages are anonymous.

Crumbs avoids many concerns, e.g. technological, environment impact, reputational and security, of Bitcoin, and provides a glimpse of the future.

Crumbs is open-source, community driven and truly decentralized.

No one owns Crumbs, everyone can take part.
